In the Northern Hemisphere, they can be found in the North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans, as well as the Arctic Ocean during summer months. In the Southern Hemisphere, they inhabit the Antarctic, Indian, and southwestern Pacific Oceans. They migrate according to food availability, typically moving towards the poles during the summer months for feeding and back towards the equator in the winter for breeding and calving.",

They lack limbs that could support their weight on land, and their bodies are not structured to breathe air or to obtain food from terrestrial sources. Additionally, their buoyant bodies would not be able to move effectively against gravity on land. In summary, blue whales are designed for life in the aquatic environment.",

Seagulls feed on various organisms such as fish and invertebrates, while blue whales primarily consume krill and small schooling fish. In some cases, seagulls may follow feeding blue whales to scavenge on any leftovers or byproducts of the whale's meals. However, their habitats and diets are quite distinct. Seagulls can be found in coastal areas all around the world, while blue whales prefer deep ocean waters.",
