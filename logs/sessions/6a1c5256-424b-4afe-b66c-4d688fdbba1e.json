      "content": " Sure! Here's a recipe for traditional Spaghetti Carbonara:\n\nIngredients:\n- 2 servings of spaghetti (preferably thick spaghetti like spaghettoni)\n- 100g pancetta or guanciale (Italian cured pork cheek), cut into small cubes\n- 2 large eggs, at room temperature\n- 1/2 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese, plus more for serving\n- 1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese\n- Freshly ground black pepper\n- Salt\n- 2 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed\n- 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n- Chopped fresh parsley, for garnish (optional)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Cook the spaghetti in a large pot of salted boiling water until al dente. Reserve 2 cups of pasta cooking water before draining the pasta.\n\n2. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the smashed garlic cloves and cook for about 1 minute until fragrant, but not browned. Remove the garlic from the pan (you can discard it or save it for another use).\n\n3. Increase the heat to medium-high and add the pancetta to the skillet. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the pancetta is crisp and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove the pancetta from the pan and set aside on a plate lined with paper towels.\n\n4. In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, Pecorino Romano cheese, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, and some black pepper. Season with salt to taste.\n\n5. Immediately after draining the pasta, add the hot spaghetti to the egg mixture. Toss well to coat the pasta in the sauce. Be careful not to let the eggs scramble from the heat of the pasta. If necessary, add some reserved pasta cooking water to help create a creamy sauce.\n\n6. Add the crisped pancetta and toss to combine. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper if needed.\n\n7. Divide the carbonara between plates, and garnish with additional grated cheese and chopped parsley (if using). Serve immediately. Enjoy your homemade Spaghetti Carbonara!",
